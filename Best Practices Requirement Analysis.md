First, I’ll go over the best practices that was discussed. These include things like:

Proper variable naming conventions: Using clear, descriptive names for variables.

Code modularity: Breaking down code into functions or classes to improve readability and reusability.

Efficient algorithms: Writing algorithms that are not only correct but also optimized for performance.

Exception handling: Properly using try-catch blocks to handle errors gracefully.

Documentation: Writing comments and documentation to explain the code’s purpose and logic.

Second is to Identify Applied Best Practices

I opened my submitted Midterm Requirement work and start going through the code. Here’s what I’ll look for:

Variable Naming Conventions: Are my variables named in a way that makes their purpose clear?

Code Modularity: Did I break down the code into smaller, manageable pieces?

Efficient Algorithms: Are the algorithms I used efficient and well-written?

Exception Handling: Did I properly handle exceptions using try-catch blocks?

Documentation: Are there comments and documentation explaining the code?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Explanation of Best Practices Implemented:

1. Variable Naming Conventions:

// Proper variable naming convention: 'studentList' clearly indicates a list of students
List<Student> studentList = new ArrayList<>();

Here, 'studentList' is a clear and descriptive name, indicating that this variable holds a list of Student objects.

2. Code Modularity:

// Code modularity: The following method breaks down the task of calculating the average grade
public static double calculateAverageGrade(List<Student> students) {
    // Efficient algorithm: Using a for-each loop for better readability and performance
    double total = 0;
    for (Student student : students) {
        total += student.getGrade();
    }
    return total / students.size();
}

The 'calculateAverageGrade' method is a separate function that encapsulates the logic for calculating the average grade, promoting code reusability and readability.

3. Efficient Algorithms:

// Efficient algorithm: Using a for-each loop for better readability and performance
double total = 0;
for (Student student : students) {
    total += student.getGrade();
}
return total / students.size();

The for-each loop is used for better readability and performance compared to a traditional for loop.

4. Exception Handling:

// Exception handling: Using try-with-resources to handle potential file I/O errors
try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filename))) {
    String line;
    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
        // Process each line (in a real scenario, you'd parse and add to studentList)
        System.out.println("Read line: " + line);
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Properly handling the IOException
    e.printStackTrace();
}
The try-with-resources statement is used for handling file I/O, ensuring that resources are properly closed after use, and exceptions are caught and handled.
